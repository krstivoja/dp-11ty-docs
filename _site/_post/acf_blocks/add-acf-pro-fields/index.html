<h2>Create Block</h2>
<p><strong>The first step is to create Gutenberg block</strong>, so you have where to assign ACF fields to it. If Block is not created you will not be able to target fields location.</p>
<h2>Create and Assign field to block</h2>
<p>You need to have <strong>ACF Pro</strong> to be able to assign fields to the blocks.</p>
<p>Navigate to <strong>Custom Fields</strong> &gt; <strong>Fields Groups</strong> and hit <strong>&quot;<strong>Add new</strong>&quot;</strong> button.</p>
<p>My best practice is to add same title as Block title and add prefix &quot;Block -&quot; Hello World.</p>
<p>Bellow you can create needed fields</p>
<p>Under location be sure to chose:<br>
<strong>&quot;Block&quot; - &quot;is equal to&quot; - &quot;Block name&quot;</strong> in this case &quot;Hello World&quot;.</p>
