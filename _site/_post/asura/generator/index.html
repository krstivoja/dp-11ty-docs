<ol>
<li>Navigate to <strong>Oxygen &gt; Asura</strong></li>

<li>Fill the “Label” field with any name.</li>
<li>Fill the “Character Map” field with a string. The best practice is alphanumeric characters. The generated license key will use this character map to produce random keys. A longer set of characters will produce a higher chance of creating a unique key, and a number of the license key can be generated.</li>
<li>Fill the “# of chunks” and “Chunk length” field with number. A higher number will generate a longer license key, which will produce a higher chance of creating a unique license key.</li>
<li>(Optional) Fill the “Prefix”, “Suffix”, and “Separator” field with character or string. The value will be inserted into license key.</li>
<li>(Optional) Fill the “Max Activation”, and “Expire in” field with number. The license will expire after several day(s) and have limited activation.</li>
