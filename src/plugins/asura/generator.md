# Generator

## Creating Generator

1. Navigate to **Oxygen &gt; Asura**
2. Click the **Generators** tab at the top of the screen.
3. Click the **Add New** button on the top of the screen.
4. Fill the “Label” field with any name.
5. Fill the “Character Map” field with a string. The best practice is alphanumeric characters. The generated license key will use this character map to produce random keys. A longer set of characters will produce a higher chance of creating a unique key, and a number of the license key can be generated.
6. Fill the “# of chunks” and “Chunk length” field with number. A higher number will generate a longer license key, which will produce a higher chance of creating a unique license key.
7. (Optional) Fill the “Prefix”, “Suffix”, and “Separator” field with character or string. The value will be inserted into license key.
8. (Optional) Fill the “Max Activation”, and “Expire in” field with number. The license will expire after several day(s) and have limited activation.
9. Fill the “Terms” field by choosing the design sets that will assigned to the license.
10. Click the **Submit** button.
